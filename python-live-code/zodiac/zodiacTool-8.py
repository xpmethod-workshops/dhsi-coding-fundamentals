"""
While taking a class on the culture of China, you have learned about the Chinese zodiac in which people fall into 1 of 12 categories, depending on the year of their birth. The categories, numbered 0 to 11, correspond to the following animals: 
(0) monkey, (1) rooster, (2) dog, (3) pig, (4) rat, (5) ox, (6) tiger, (7) rabbit, (8) dragon, (9) snake, (10) horse, (11) goat. Those who believe in this zodiac think that the year of a person's birth influences both their personality and fortune in life.

To find your zodiac sign, divide the year of your birth by 12. The remainder then determines your sign. For example: The remainder when we divide 1985 by 12, is 5; therefore, a person born in 1985 is an ox according to the Chinese zodiac.
